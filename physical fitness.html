        <h3>Ernest Fitnes Journey</h3>
        <p>My fitness Journey started one day, I was standing right in front of a mirror looking at my skinny body, then and they I<br />
             knew I had to do something about my health so I started a personal training; my fitness goal was to be bulky and thick <br />
             like Dwain Jonson |The Rock|. I started training my body at home without equipments, I will usually do pushups, plank,<br />
             military pushups, I even do chin-up using my War-drop, i will also run every morning  after  three months I saw amazing<br />
             result, so this motivated me even the more though  I was really desperate for  big and bulky body so I seek help from the<br />
              internet, I was asked by the internet to do the following.  Gym, eat good, have enough sleep and rest, I did all of these <br />
              and saw amazing result. One day I decided to run in the morning before work through my usual rout, I discovered that I could <br />
              no longer cover the distance I used to cover before, above all i was not as fast as i used to be, so that day when I got home<br />
             I had to ask myself what I really want in my fitness journey? The hard truth about fitness remain the fact that you can’t be <br />
             thick, bulky and fast at the same time, and you can’t be fast in running with an incredible seeped with a bulky and thick body <br />
              at the same time  one has to go, that night I was forced to make a hard decision, I had to chose running over gym, but I combined<br />
               it, run lift weights, bench press chin-ups, pushups and seat-up etc so I will still come out a shining armor. <br />
        <h3>Summary</h3>
